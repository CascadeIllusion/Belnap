# Belnap
Implementation of Belnap Four-Valued Logic in C++

## About
Belnap Logic is a multi-valued logic system proposed by Nuel Belnap (1977) for the purpose of expressing paraconsistency (contradictions)
and indeterminacy (unknowns). It consists of four values: the familiar True and False, as well as the values Both (True and False at
the same time) and Neither (True nor False; unknown). Belnap Logic is modeled using a diamond, which represents a two-dimensional 
relationship between increasing / decreasing truth versus information.

Besides its usefulness in modeling situations of both uncertain and conflicting information, Belnap Logic has potentially useful 
applications in computer science, particularly in databases.

Belnap is a planned library that will be able to be freely imported in any project that can benefit from using four-valued logic.
